# Java Chessboard

This was just a chessboard. I've updated it and now you can move pieces + load a custom [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) file! However, there is
no move validation yet (you can move the rooks diagonally!).

## Requirements (Debian based distros)
```
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```
 
## Compilation and running
```
make all
```
Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 64-bit
